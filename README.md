# Power-BI--customer-churn-and-risk-analysis
#### This project shows key metrics like the number of customers at risk, tech and admin tickets, yearly and monthly charges, and customer demographics such as age and gender. The dashboard also highlights important information about payment methods, contract types, and whether customers use paperless billing. Additionally, it breaks down churn rates by internet service type and looks at the impact of different contract lengths on churn. The goal is to help businesses understand and reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers and factors that influence their decisions to leave.
